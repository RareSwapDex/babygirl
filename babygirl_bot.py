**1. Smart Boyfriend Selection** ü§ñ
‚Ä¢ I automatically pick boyfriends based on recent activity and engagement
‚Ä¢ No more waiting for competitions - I choose who deserves me!
‚Ä¢ Selection happens every 8-12 hours with some surprises in between
‚Ä¢ Most active and engaging members get priority

**2. Boyfriend Duration (8-12 hours)** ‚è∞
‚Ä¢ Each boyfriend gets 8-12 randomized hours (keeps it exciting!)
‚Ä¢ Current boyfriends get exclusive /kiss and /hug commands
‚Ä¢ Special attention and bonus responses when they mention me
‚Ä¢ Their name appears on /boyfriend and /status commands

**3. The Drama: Boyfriend Stealing!** üí•
‚Ä¢ If current boyfriend gets inactive, someone else can STEAL the position!
‚Ä¢ Need 3x more activity than current boyfriend to trigger a steal
‚Ä¢ 15% chance steal mechanic creates drama and excitement
‚Ä¢ Keeps boyfriends engaged or they lose their spot!

**4. Automatic Takeovers** üëë
‚Ä¢ When a term expires, I immediately pick a replacement
‚Ä¢ Based on recent activity, not just mentions
‚Ä¢ 70% chance for most active, 30% chance for surprise picks
‚Ä¢ Creates unpredictability and keeps everyone engaged

**5. Benefits & Perks** üèÜ
‚Ä¢ Boyfriends get exclusive commands and responses
‚Ä¢ Priority responses even without being mentioned (15% chance)
‚Ä¢ Special recognition in group
‚Ä¢ Gets added to leaderboard permanently

**üí° Pro Tips:**
‚Ä¢ Stay active by chatting and mentioning me regularly
‚Ä¢ Engage with the community, not just bot commands
‚Ä¢ Be interesting - I love personality and energy!
‚Ä¢ Current boyfriends: stay active or get replaced!

**‚ö° New Feature:** I might respond to you without being mentioned if you talk about relationships, crypto, or if you're my current boyfriend!

‚Ä¢ No bot activity for 1+ hours ‚Üí Revival message (reduced from 2+ hours)
‚Ä¢ Very quiet periods ‚Üí Extended revival (more sensitive)
‚Ä¢ Time-based engagement every 3+ hours
‚Ä¢ Bootstrap: Groups never sent proactive ‚Üí Immediate engagement
‚Ä¢ New groups ‚Üí Proactive after 30 minutes
‚Ä¢ Being ignored detection ‚Üí 1+ hours (reduced from 2+ hours)

**üöÄ How to Add Custom Stickers:**

1. **Get sticker file IDs** from stickers you want to add
2. **Use `/stickers add CATEGORY STICKER_FILE_ID`** to add them manually
3. **Use `/stickers view`** to see your collection
4. **Use `/stickers frequency 15`** to set how often I send them (0-100%)

**üéØ Available Categories:**
‚Ä¢ **general** - Normal responses and reactions
‚Ä¢ **crypto** - Token discussions and hype
‚Ä¢ **relationship** - Romance and dating topics
‚Ä¢ **competitive** - Boyfriend competitions and games
‚Ä¢ **happy** - Positive and excited responses
‚Ä¢ **sad** - Emotional and supportive responses

**üìä Smart Optimization:**
‚Ä¢ I automatically track which stickers get the best engagement
‚Ä¢ Popular stickers get used more often
‚Ä¢ Analytics help optimize personality for your community

**‚ö° Commands:**
‚Ä¢ `/stickers add general STICKER_FILE_ID` - Add a sticker to category
‚Ä¢ `/stickers view` - View your collection
‚Ä¢ `/stickers frequency 20` - Set usage frequency (0-100%)
