# 📢 Babygirl Bot Deployment Notification System

Every time you deploy new features, Babygirl can automatically announce the updates to all active groups in her signature flirty style! 💅✨

## 🚀 **Automatic Deployment Notifications (Heroku)**

### **Default Behavior**
Every time you click "Deploy" on Heroku, Babygirl **automatically** sends a deployment notification to all active groups! No manual commands needed! 🎉

**What happens:**
1. You click "Deploy Branch" on Heroku
2. Heroku builds and deploys your app
3. **Automatic notification** gets sent to all groups
4. Your bot starts running with the updates

### **Default Deployment Message**
```
🔄 **Fresh Deployment:** I just got redeployed with the latest updates! Everything is running smooth and I'm ready to flirt! 💅

💾 **Current Features:** Conversation memory, chat summaries, proactive engagement, and all my boyfriend competition games! 

🎯 **Ready to Chat:** Mention @babygirl_bf_bot to experience the full upgraded experience!
```

### **Custom Deployment Messages**
To send a **custom message** for a specific deployment:

1. **Go to Heroku Dashboard** → Your App → Settings → Config Vars
2. **Add a new config var:**
   - **Key:** `DEPLOYMENT_MESSAGE`
   - **Value:** `Your custom deployment message here! 💕`
3. **Deploy normally** - your custom message will be sent!

**Example Custom Messages:**
```
I can now remember our conversations and reference things you told me before! It's like having a real relationship! 🥰💕

Added crypto discussion features! I'll tag you cuties when chat gets quiet and start $BABYGIRL hype talks! 🔥🚀

New /summary command added! Get a 12-hour recap of everything you missed! Perfect for busy cuties! ✨📋
```

## 🛠️ **Manual Deployment Notifications (Optional)**

If you want to send additional notifications manually:

### **Option 1: Send Latest Update (Current Features)**
```bash
python3 deployment_notifier.py
```
This sends a pre-written message about the latest features (conversation memory, summaries, etc.)

### **Option 2: Send Custom Update**
```bash
python3 send_update.py "Your custom update message here"
```

**Example:**
```bash
python3 send_update.py "I can now tag you cuties when chat gets quiet and remember everything we talk about! It's like having a real relationship now! 🥰"
```
